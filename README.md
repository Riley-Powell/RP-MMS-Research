# RP-MMS-Research
This is a repository for a unh research project, the goal of said project is too identify timeframes that contain magnetopause reconnection jets. The file Evaluating Parameters contains the main code and functions which  take in a start time and end time and outputs if the time frame contains a jet or not, the function runs at 85% percent accuracy. The files function folder and time to orbit are files compiled from a repositroy written by Matthew Argall, these files contain functions that format the data into a form that is usable for the algorithm used. The file mms validation data contains code that is also written by Matthew argall that prints various datastreams for a time frame from the mms space craft.
